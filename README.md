### What is it all about?

Random domino tilings are a fascinating topic in mathematics that involve placing dominoes (rectangular tiles) on a grid in a random manner, subject to certain constraints. The goal is to understand the properties of these random tilings and the patterns that emerge.

There are several types of random domino tilings, including:

* Uniform random tilings:  In this type, each possible tiling has an equal probability of being chosen.

* Domino-shuffling algorithm tilings:  This method involves starting with a fixed tiling and then applying a series of random moves to obtain a new tiling.

### What is in the project?

The __Aztec diamond__ is a specific region of the plane that is often used as a testing ground for understanding random domino tilings. It is defined as the set of all grid points (x, y) that satisfy |x| + |y| â‰¤ n

The __Arctic Circle theorem__ is a fundamental result in the study of random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. It states that, as the size of the diamond grows, the boundary between the "frozen" and "unfrozen" regions of the tiling forms a circle with a specific radius. This circle is known as the Arctic Circle.

Finally, __Lozenge domino tilings__ are a variant of random domino tilings that involve placing lozenge-shaped tiles on a grid. These tilings have many interesting properties and connections to other areas of mathematics, such as statistical mechanics and combinatorics. 

> Drawn, they create the illusion of 3D. Moreover, there is a close relationship between lozenge tilings and certain statistical mechanical models that describe the behavior of particles in 3D space. This connection, known as the "height function representation" allows us to interpret lozenge tilings as 3D configurations of particles, with each lozenge tile corresponding to a particle at a specific height.
In fact, the height function representation can be used to derive many interesting properties of lozenge tilings, such as their scaling limits and fluctuations. This makes lozenge tilings a rich and fruitful area of study with connections to a wide range of mathematical disciplines. But in this project, only distribution that spawns the Arctic Circle is implemented.

### Controls

In each scene, you can use the controls to generate the tiling. Use the WASD QE and SHIFT keys and the mouse to move the camera around. To rotate hold middle mouse button. To iterate one time click anywhere. 

In 3d mode, after entering both values, you must press enter or anywhere outside the input fields. If there was an incorrect input (not a positive integer), then nothing will happen, but it will not be possible to make an input again. You will have to exit the menu and open the mode back.
